## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

The goal of this project is to optimize a website provided by Udacity, using the skills learned in the Optimization mini-course in the Frontend Developer Nanodegree program.  To succeed, FPS needs to remain at 60 throughout the site, and the Google Page Speed Insights score needs to be above 90 (to start, it was in the 20s).
